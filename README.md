üëã **Welcome in!** üëã

This repository contains the Open Source code for [gliff.ai](https://gliff.ai)‚Äôs ANNOTATE product. 

ANNOTATE aims to allow domain experts to easily and efficiently annotate multidimensional images - embedding their knowledge - for the purposes of developing imaging AI products. ANNOTATE is just one part of [gliff.ai](https://gliff.ai/)‚Äôs growing privacy-preserving MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) platform. When the full [gliff.ai platform](https://gliff.ai/software/) is used, ANNOTATE provides just one step in developing high-quality and auditable datasets that satisfy any relevant regulatory frameworks which enables our users to build world-changing and trustworthy AI models and products.

A preview build of the current `main` branch is [here](https://annotate.staging.gliff.app/).

Frontend code should always be written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and transpiled using the options in `tsconfig.json` in this repository. npm should always be used for package management.

`npm run serve` will run a local webpack developer server for quick access.

## Linting and Formatting

[{{back to navigation}}](#table-of-contents)

As a standard, all code contributions should be linted with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) using `.eslintrc.js` and formatted with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). **Note:** HTML + CSS, mark-up and mark-down code are exemptions and should be formatted using [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) but do not need to be linted.

`npm run lint` will lint the codebase.

Our GitHub Actions will also lint any pull requests before they're merged.

## Testing

[{{back to navigation}}](#table-of-contents)

All code contributions should be tested using both the [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/).

`npm run test` will run any existing tests in our codebase.

Our GitHub Actions will also test any pull requests before they're merged! These all must pass and have 2 reviewers approval before a pull request can merge. If one or a few fail and your troubleshooting is not giving an answer, please check out the [gliff.ai Contribution Guide](https://github.com/gliff-ai/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) üëã for further guidance.
